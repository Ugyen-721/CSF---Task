#the function greet is defined to display "hello there,"
#but since the function is not called, nothing will be displayed when you run the code.

#def greet():
    #print("hello there")

# The function is defined, but not called
# So, nothing will be displayed at this point

# To see the expected output, you need to call the function
#greet()
